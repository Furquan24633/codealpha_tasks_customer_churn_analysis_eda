Customer Churn  Analysis EDA

I recently wrapped up a Customer Churn Analysis project where I used Python to explore what drives customers to stay or leave. The dataset had 7,043 customer records, so I started with cleaning and preprocessing. I fixed blank entries in the TotalCharges column, converted object fields into numeric types and checked for missing and duplicate values. Once everything was consistent, the analysis became much clearer.

A few insights from the exploratory analysis stood out:
• 26.54% of customers have churned, which is a sizable portion.
• Customers on month-to-month contracts churn far more than those with 1- or 2-year contracts.
• People with very low tenure churn the most. Many customers who stayed for 1–3 months did not continue, while long-term users showed much higher retention.
• Senior citizens churn at a higher rate compared to others.
• Customers using Electronic Check as a payment method churn the most compared to Bank Transfer or Credit Card users.
• Users of fibre optic internet show higher churn than DSL users.
• Customers who don’t use add-on services like Online Security, Tech Support or Device Protection tend to leave more quickly.

Working on this helped me practice data cleaning, descriptive statistics, visual exploration and thinking through patterns in a real dataset.
